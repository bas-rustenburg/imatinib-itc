# ITC of Abl and imatinib


Based on the Seeliger paper [1] and Klebe paper [2]

Hepes, Tris, and tricine buffer at pH 7.8 [2]

Seeliger uses [1]:

Buffer 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0),
100 mM NaCl,
10% glycerol, 1 mM TCEP,
5% DMSO

Abl concentration between : 10–50 mM.

Imatinib stocks DMSO were diluted 20-fold with buffer to a final concentration
of 1–500 mM.

The heat of binding was measured over the injection of 295 mL of drug in 12-mL steps
spaced 300 sec apart. (VPITC has 1 ml cell?)

## TODO

- Make recipes for 1 L of
    - 50 mM Hepes, Tris, or Tricine
    - 100 mM NaCl
    - 10% glycerol
    - 1 mM TCEP
    - 5% DMSO

- Check whether in the future it will be possible to have the Revo make these

- Calculate scaled down volumes for Seeliger protocol (VPITC versus ITC-200)

    -
     Alternatively, use heuristic equations with the concentrations given in the Seeliger paper and see if we can find a more "optimal" setup

- Check our Imatinib stocks

- Investigate if we want to use more buffers than just the Klebe buffers

- Do we have Abl, or are we able to get Abl at a short notice?

    - Use Single mutant possibly. Did Seeliger use this - D382N
