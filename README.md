Their performed ITC experiments show that the affinity (dG) does not depend on the pH, but the dH and TdS change based on the pH.

#### From methods section
Thermodynamic binding parameters for the binding of inhibitors to the enzymes were obtained through isothermal titration calorimetry in a VP-ITC instrument (Micro-cal) at 30° C.

Proteins were exchanged into 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM TCEP, 5% DMSO on PD-10 buffer exchange columns (GE Life-science), and diluted to 10–50 μM. Imatinib stocks (purified from clinically available capsules, Novartis) in 100% DMSO were diluted 20-fold with buffer to a final concentration of 1–500 μM. The heat of binding was measured over the injection of 295 μL of drug in 12-μL steps spaced 300 sec apart. Data were fitted to a one binding site model using the Origin software package (Microcal).
